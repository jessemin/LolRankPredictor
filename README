Rank Predictor:
    python PredictRank.py
UpDown Predictor:
    python PredictUpDown.py
To run everything streamlined:
    sh run.sh


Brief code structure:
features.py and rank_Predictor.py are classes for feature extractor and predictors respectively.
They are used in PredictRank.py and PredictUpDown.py to predict exact rank of the users and whether the users' rank go up, down, or stay.
statsApi.py is a helper class that contains all the functionalities regarding Riot API usage to gather user info and match history.
Finally, run.sh folder is a simple bash script that runs both PredictRank.py and PredictUpDown.py consecutively.
